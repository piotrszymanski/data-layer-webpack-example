## Instructions

You need to have `node` and `npm` installed. Then, do the following:

```
# Clone the repository.
$ git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/piotrszymanski/data-layer-webpack-example.git data-layer-example

# Change into data-layer-example.
cd data-layer-example

# Put a copy of data-layer-0.1.0.tgz into this folder.
